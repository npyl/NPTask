#  NSAuthenticatedTask

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT (currently supports basic functions)**

A framework that adds a small perk to NSTask (Authentication) so you can execute your task with root permissions!
Follows Apple's recommended way of doing this, using SMJobBlessHelper and XPC! (No deprecated APIs here!)

- [ ] Pipes
