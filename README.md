#  NSAuthenticatedTask

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT (currently supports basic functions)**

A framework that adds administrator Authentication support to NSTask so you can execute your task with root privileges!
Follows Apple's recommended way of doing it (using SMJobBlessHelper and XPC) so no deprecated APIs here!

## Supported Features
- [x] Standard (NSTask) functionality
- [x] Launch Authenticated
- [x] Pass arguments
- [x] Pass current directory
- [x] Custom Authentication Icon (still quite buggy, though! [#3](https://github.com/npyl/NSAuthenticatedTask/issues/3))
- [x] Custom Authentication Text
- [ ] Pass environment variables
- [x] Pipes (nearly done)
